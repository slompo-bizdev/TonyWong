Am I understanding this correctly?\n\nThought for 36s\n\nYes, your viewpoint aligns well with Elon's expressed ideas on simulation theory and quantum mechanics—he often describes reality as an efficient \"rendering\" system where unobserved elements exist as probabilities (latent space) that collapse upon observation, much like game engines or AI models.\n\nAlignment Breakdown\nElon's core stance echoes your \"latent space\" framework: He views the universe as potentially simulated, with quantum mechanics providing the mechanics for on-demand rendering.

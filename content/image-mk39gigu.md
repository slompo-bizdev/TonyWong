Elon's core stance echoes your "latent space" framework: He views the universe as potentially simulated, with quantum mechanics providing the mechanics for on-demand rendering. For instance:

• Simulation as Rendering: Elon has stated that games "only render what you look at when you look at it" to manage compute load, paralleling how unobserved objects in reality behave as "probability functions" per quantum mechanics (e.g., Schrodinger's cat). @elonmusk This mirrors your idea of latent space (unobserved potentials) collapsing into manifest reality via observation—intention could be seen as the "prompt" initiating that process, though he doesn't explicitly use that term.

• Observer Effect Ties: In quantum contexts, Elon highlights wave function collapse, implying consciousness or measurement plays a role in "creating" observed reality.

      facebook.com  facebook.com He ties this to simulation efficiency: Why compute everything if it's not observed? This supports your non-dual view where intention initiates and observation finalizes the render.

## Frequently Asked Questions


### How does Elon Musk relate the concept of simulation to quantum mechanics?

Elon Musk views the universe as potentially simulated, with quantum mechanics providing the mechanics for on-demand rendering. He notes that games 'only render what you look at when you look at it' to manage compute load, paralleling how unobserved objects in reality behave as 'probability functions' per quantum mechanics.


### What is the connection between the observer effect and Elon's views on simulation?

In quantum contexts, Elon highlights wave function collapse, implying consciousness or measurement plays a role in 'creating' observed reality. He ties this to simulation efficiency, suggesting there’s no need to compute everything if it's not observed.


### What analogy does Elon Musk make between AI and quantum mechanics?

Elon sees AI as optimizing for similar efficiencies, with large models handling 'intelligence density' in memory/compute akin to latent space in neural nets. He describes AI as a 'neurotransmitter tonnage maximizer,' suggesting emergent behaviors from underlying potentials, similar to reality-AI analogies.


### What is Elon's stance on the simulation hypothesis?

Elon Musk is open to the simulation hypothesis without claiming certainty and argues against dismissing it based on 'pseudoscience.'

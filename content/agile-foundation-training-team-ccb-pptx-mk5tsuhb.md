To improve responsibility for timeliness, assign penalties such as buying lunch for latecomers. • Stay Present – No cell phones, no laptops, no leaving the room. • Everything is Time Boxed – The Time Box nature of Agile is designed to encourage decisive thinking to facilitate moving forward quickly. • Please ask Questions – This training is for You. (Ask any and all questions that occur.) • Have fun! Agile Training // Introduction What do you want to get out of today? • What do you know about Agile? – What have you heard about Agile? – What are the challenges to adoption? – What are the challenges to implementation? • Describe how project management has been for you in the past. – How do you get directions i.e. how do you receive your marching orders? – Has it been empowering to you? – How much time do you spend being managed vs. doing actual work? Why? – What would work better? – In your past experience, what’s been the value of a Project Manager? • What areas would you like to focus on? Agile Training // Wrap-Up The Pitfalls of Agile • What Agile is not: 1. Doing the daily stand up and then continuing your projects the same old way you used to. 2. Doing the phases of waterfall like scope, design or build in 4-week chunks. − Having Creatives do their work and then handoff documents/designs for Technology to implement. 3. And finally, it’s not doing Fixed Price, Fixed Scope and Fixed Cost SOW’s. • Teams naturally do not self-organize. − Think of any example in your business or personal life where people actually self-organize. They don’t. They need leadership and structure to provide the environment for self-organization. • Agile works best when teams are physically co-located, projects have dedicated resources and the individuals have made a choice/commitment to successfully completing the project.

Agile Training // Why is Agile Needed? • Waterfall is predictive. Its core assumption is that you can accurately and precisely plan and predict how to achieve an outcome of a project. • Agile on the other hand is empirical. Its core assumption is that you cannot accurately and precisely plan and predict the outcome of a project. – Typical Agile says “fix the time and cost but scope is completely unknown” – This is a tough sell Agile Training // Why is Agile Needed? Waterfall // It’s a Toaster • I split the difference. The teams l lead can – and must- define an outcome of a project, you just can’t predict precisely and accurately how much scope will be delivered. • “The Promise” and “The Stretch” – this is how you make Agile work in the real world. Waterfall // It’s a Toaster Agile Training // Why is Agile Needed? • What rules in this environment is the PLAN. • That’s why it takes so long up front. • But, plans are way overrated. Waterfall // The Plan Agile Training // Why is Agile Needed? “Everyone has a plan…until they get punched in the face.” ~ Mike Tyson, boxer Waterfall // Can Anyone Relate To This?

Further results indicate 52.7% of projects will cost 189% of original estimates. On the success side, the average is only 16.2% for software projects that are completed on-time and on-budget. In the larger companies, the news is even worse: only 9% of their projects come in on-time and on-budget. Agile Training // Why is Agile Needed? Our World // The Stats “In the United States, we spend more than $250 billion each year on IT application development of approximately 175,000 projects. The average cost of a development project for a large company is $2,322,000; for a medium company, it is $1,331,000; and for a small company, it is $434,000. A great many of these projects will fail. Software development projects are in chaos, and we can no longer imitate the three monkeys -- hear no failures, see no failures, speak no failures.” “The average is only 16.2% for software projects that are completed on- time and on-budget. In the larger companies, the news is even worse: only 9% of their projects come in on-time and on-budget. And, even when these projects are completed, many are no more than a mere shadow of their original specification requirements. Projects completed by the largest American companies have only approximately 42% of the originally-proposed features and functions. Smaller companies do much better. A total of 78.4% of their software projects will get deployed with at least 74.2% of their original features and functions.” Agile Training // Why is Agile Needed? Our World // 1995 Standish Report Agile Training // Why is Agile Needed? Our World // PM Studies It’s a big circle: In fact, it’s a bunch of circles… Agile Training // Why is Agile Needed? Our World // Iterative One of the biggest reasons for cycles (sprints) Agile Training // Why is Agile Needed? Our World // Iterative Empirical (non-predictive) Therefore, you must know what’s important and tell us. And it’s your job to stay vigilant to validate your prioritization. Empirical looks like this: Which is iterative and incremental Then at each “loop” you control the ROI by having us work on a prioritized backlog. Finally, adapt and plan empirically.

Agile Training // Why is Agile Needed? Our World // What Is It? An adaptive Project Management style Incremental development and release cycles completion = meeting Client’s Goals (not producing finite, scoped deliverables) Project timeline is a series of 2 to 4 week “Sprints” Small teams (3-7 people) used to meet Sprint’s goal Client feedback and collaboration incorporated frequently Agile Training // Why is Agile Needed?

Agile Works // It Is… DesignPlan Build Sprint 1 Sprint End DesignPlan Build Sprint 2 Sprint End Project Start Project End Agile Training // Why is Agile Needed? Agile Works // Project Layout The typical reasons organizations use Agile: • Accelerate time to market • Enhance ability to manage changing priorities • Increase productivity • Provides transparency Agile Training // Why is Agile Needed? Agile Works // Why Use Agile Clients love the results. Agile Training // Why is Agile Needed? “Your system is really relieving a lot of my stress about the management of ASB and our ability to take on big new projects.” ~ R Blank, CTO Almer/Blank “You guys are giving me the confidence to open up more business to you.” ~ Kurt Kratchman, President, ASB “The biggest value has been the lack of hands on management from my end. AND I’m getting what I expect in terms of project quality.” ~ Michael Smith, Head of Engineering, INQ Mobile Agile Works // Client Satisfaction And they sign up for new projects, over and over… Agile Training // Why is Agile Needed? In 5 months, my client created two, long-term, repeat clients with this system. • “ASB” started with 1 Sprint. Now it’s on Sprint 9 and still going. • INQ Mobile also started with 1 Sprint. Now it’s on Sprint 5 with 8 Sprints more planned. Agile Works // Repeat Business Do more with less. Agile Training // Why is Agile Needed? Reduce management effort by up to 40%. My recent teams calculated that each team member saved 6 hours per week of “management time.” On an 8 person team, that’s 192 hours per month that the team now has available to do actual project work. What could you do with this extra capacity? Agile Works // Efficiently Increase profits. Agile Training // Why is Agile Needed? Projects always come in under budget. My last 14 Sprints all came in under budget. • No charge-backs, no schedule slip, no change requests. Guaranteed margins. 8 of the 14 Sprints had an extra 9%- 26% profit. Example: for an $87,000 Sprint, final gross margin was $54,000 or 62% margin. Agile Works // Profitability Improve productivity. Agile Training // Why is Agile Needed? No more “project fires” in your email. No more late night calls. No more meetings. Work is handled…at work. People can take vacations without worry. Michael: focuses on his “other projects” Tom: vacations in France. Markus: works on new business People do high value work instead of putting out fires or sitting in meetings. Agile Works // Productivity Create higher quality work. Agile Training // Why is Agile Needed? Because of collaborative teamwork, design and build are closely integrated to produce better results. But mostly, because of shortened feedback loops between design & implementation - between client approvals and working software, better creative and better technology is produced. Agile Works // Higher Quality Agile Training // Why is Agile Needed? By the 3 rd Sprint of every project, you’ll know the pivot point of where Project Profits balance with Client Satisfaction. With predictable results, projects run on auto-pilot. Knowing this formula, your team is empowered to consistently deliver predictable results. Create predictable results. Agile Works // Predictability • Long-term Business Benefits ✔ Your clients will love the results ✔ Do more with less • Financial Benefits ✔ Increase Profits • Business Culture Benefits ✔ Improve productivity ✔ Produce predictable results Agile Training // Why is Agile Needed? Agile Works // Tangible Benefits • Most of all, use Agile because, it works much better than waterfall for our software projects. But…many organizations fail in its implementation. Agile in it’s current form takes an expert to implement. Agile Training // Why is Agile Needed? Agile Works // Why Use Agile? 2009 State of Agile Survey says the top 2 reasons for Agile failure are: 1. Lack of experience with agile methods 2. Company culture at odds with core agile values The failed implementations I see are “scrumerfall.” Agile Training // Why is Agile Needed?

Writing out tasks engenders ownership & responsibility. The planning session starts with the goal to focus everyone’s attention on what needs to be accomplished. The client confirms that the team members understand the project vision and objectives. See where you’re going. See where you are. See how to get there. See how to get there. Agile Training // Agile Team Member The Big Picture // Sprint Planning 1. What did you do yesterday? 2. What are you doing today? 3. Is there anything standing in your way? Limiting the daily meeting to 15 minutes increases efficiency and accuracy. In-person meetings reduce email inefficiencies and miscommunication. Frequent, face-to-face check-ins eliminate miscommunication and complexity. Answering just three questions creates clarity and maintains focus. See where you are. See where you are, where you’re going and how to get there. See how to get there. See how to get there. Agile Training // Agile Team Member The Big Picture // Daily Check-In • 15 minute Daily Check-In meeting – Each team member answers three questions: 1. What did you do yesterday? 2. What are you going to do today? 3. Are there any obstacles standing in your way? • Seeing… – …what’s working and what’s not – …what adjustments need to be made – …what we didn’t predict – …everything Agile Training // Agile Team Member The Big Picture // Daily Check-In Seeing How To Get There If necessary, the team adjusts the plan to ensure they will succeed. The focus is directed back to the original Sprint goal. Don’t wait until the end of the Sprint to find out if you have succeeded or not. The team assesses their progress to see if they will succeed. See where you are. See where you’re going. See how to get there. See how to get there. Agile Training // Agile Team Member The Big Picture // Reality Check The review also gives an opportunity for feedback throughout the project - no surprises at the end. Reviewing work every 30 days allows you to see tangible results quickly. The team takes ownership of presenting their work to the client. The success of the team’s work is judged by the original Sprint goal. See where you are. See where you are. Agile Training // Agile Team Member The Big Picture // Sprint Results This process creates closure which frees the team to start the next Sprint without baggage (a round of drinks helps too). The team also celebrates what was done well. Before the next Sprint, the team collaborates to determine how they can improve. The team collectively identifies areas within the Sprint that need improvement. See where you are. See where you are. See where you are. See where you are.

Agile Training // Wrap Up Wrap Up / / Next Steps What we’ll need from each other: Gut Check Are you willing to make a choice? Do you have the courage to start? Are you willing to make the commitment to finish? No matter what? Agile Training // Wrap Up Wrap Up / / Gut Check Forewarnings to new teams • Agile will require a lot of simple things but that aren’t necessarily easy to implement. • It will unveil both things that work well and those that don’t. In existing software development teams, it reveals lots of problems. – It does this by removing the waterfall smoke and mirrors that obscure team-problems. • Here’s an example of what Agile Organizations experience: – As Agile is rolled out in an organization, it naturally removes the opacity usually present in non-Agile projects. Defects in planning, team make-up, management, and even individual performance can be made painfully obvious in very short order. – An organization unprepared for the spotlight that comes with Agile will be spending a large portion of the first couple months digging deeply and disruptively within every Agile team to find the rocks under which the obstacles have scurried. – On the other hand, an organization prepared for Agile's spotlight will be able to immediately use the resulting transparency to identify and remove obstacles while improving productivity and software quality. • Teams naturally do not self-organize. Think of any example in your business or personal life where people actually self-organize. They don’t. They need leadership and structure to provide the environment for self-organization. • The solution to this is to provide enough structure and rigor so that people can be free to be successful. • Agile works best when teams are physically co-located, projects have dedicated resources and the individuals have made a choice/commitment to successfully completing the project.

Agile Training // Introduction What do you want to get out of today? • What do you know about Agile? – What have you heard about Agile? – What are the challenges to adoption? – What are the challenges to implementation? • Describe how project management has been for you in the past. – How do you get directions i.e. how do you receive your marching orders? – Has it been empowering to you? – How much time do you spend being managed vs. doing actual work? Why? – What would work better? – In your past experience, what’s been the value of a Project Manager? • What areas would you like to focus on? Agile Training // Wrap-Up The Pitfalls of Agile • What Agile is not: 1. Doing the daily stand up and then continuing your projects the same old way you used to. 2. Doing the phases of waterfall like scope, design or build in 4-week chunks. − Having Creatives do their work and then handoff documents/designs for Technology to implement. 3. And finally, it’s not doing Fixed Price, Fixed Scope and Fixed Cost SOW’s. • Teams naturally do not self-organize. − Think of any example in your business or personal life where people actually self-organize. They don’t. They need leadership and structure to provide the environment for self-organization. • Agile works best when teams are physically co-located, projects have dedicated resources and the individuals have made a choice/commitment to successfully completing the project.

Agile Training // Why is Agile Needed? • Waterfall is predictive. Its core assumption is that you can accurately and precisely plan and predict how to achieve an outcome of a project. • Agile on the other hand is empirical. Its core assumption is that you cannot accurately and precisely plan and predict the outcome of a project. – Typical Agile says “fix the time and cost but scope is completely unknown” – This is a tough sell Agile Training // Why is Agile Needed? Waterfall // It’s a Toaster • I split the difference. The teams l lead can – and must- define an outcome of a project, you just can’t predict precisely and accurately how much scope will be delivered. • “The Promise” and “The Stretch” – this is how you make Agile work in the real world. Waterfall // It’s a Toaster Agile Training // Why is Agile Needed? • What rules in this environment is the PLAN. • That’s why it takes so long up front. • But, plans are way overrated.

Further results indicate 52.7% of projects will cost 189% of original estimates. On the success side, the average is only 16.2% for software projects that are completed on-time and on-budget. In the larger companies, the news is even worse: only 9% of their projects come in on-time and on-budget. Agile Training // Why is Agile Needed? Our World // The Stats “In the United States, we spend more than $250 billion each year on IT application development of approximately 175,000 projects. The average cost of a development project for a large company is $2,322,000; for a medium company, it is $1,331,000; and for a small company, it is $434,000. A great many of these projects will fail. Software development projects are in chaos, and we can no longer imitate the three monkeys -- hear no failures, see no failures, speak no failures.” “The average is only 16.2% for software projects that are completed on- time and on-budget. In the larger companies, the news is even worse: only 9% of their projects come in on-time and on-budget. And, even when these projects are completed, many are no more than a mere shadow of their original specification requirements. Projects completed by the largest American companies have only approximately 42% of the originally-proposed features and functions. Smaller companies do much better. A total of 78.4% of their software projects will get deployed with at least 74.2% of their original features and functions.” Agile Training // Why is Agile Needed?

Our World // Iterative Empirical (non-predictive) Therefore, you must know what’s important and tell us. And it’s your job to stay vigilant to validate your prioritization. Empirical looks like this: Which is iterative and incremental Then at each “loop” you control the ROI by having us work on a prioritized backlog. Finally, adapt and plan empirically.

Agile Training // Why is Agile Needed? Our World // What Is It? An adaptive Project Management style Incremental development and release cycles completion = meeting Client’s Goals (not producing finite, scoped deliverables) Project timeline is a series of 2 to 4 week “Sprints” Small teams (3-7 people) used to meet Sprint’s goal Client feedback and collaboration incorporated frequently Agile Training // Why is Agile Needed?

Agile Works // Project Layout The typical reasons organizations use Agile: • Accelerate time to market • Enhance ability to manage changing priorities • Increase productivity • Provides transparency Agile Training // Why is Agile Needed? Agile Works // Why Use Agile Clients love the results. Agile Training // Why is Agile Needed? “Your system is really relieving a lot of my stress about the management of ASB and our ability to take on big new projects.” ~ R Blank, CTO Almer/Blank “You guys are giving me the confidence to open up more business to you.” ~ Kurt Kratchman, President, ASB “The biggest value has been the lack of hands on management from my end. AND I’m getting what I expect in terms of project quality.” ~ Michael Smith, Head of Engineering, INQ Mobile Agile Works // Client Satisfaction And they sign up for new projects, over and over… Agile Training // Why is Agile Needed? In 5 months, my client created two, long-term, repeat clients with this system. • “ASB” started with 1 Sprint. Now it’s on Sprint 9 and still going. • INQ Mobile also started with 1 Sprint. Now it’s on Sprint 5 with 8 Sprints more planned. Agile Works // Repeat Business Do more with less. Agile Training // Why is Agile Needed? Reduce management effort by up to 40%. My recent teams calculated that each team member saved 6 hours per week of “management time.” On an 8 person team, that’s 192 hours per month that the team now has available to do actual project work. What could you do with this extra capacity? Agile Works // Efficiently Increase profits. Agile Training // Why is Agile Needed? Projects always come in under budget. My last 14 Sprints all came in under budget. • No charge-backs, no schedule slip, no change requests. Guaranteed margins. 8 of the 14 Sprints had an extra 9%- 26% profit. Example: for an $87,000 Sprint, final gross margin was $54,000 or 62% margin. Agile Works // Profitability Improve productivity. Agile Training // Why is Agile Needed? No more “project fires” in your email. No more late night calls. No more meetings. Work is handled…at work. People can take vacations without worry. Michael: focuses on his “other projects” Tom: vacations in France. Markus: works on new business People do high value work instead of putting out fires or sitting in meetings. Agile Works // Productivity Create higher quality work. Agile Training // Why is Agile Needed? Because of collaborative teamwork, design and build are closely integrated to produce better results. But mostly, because of shortened feedback loops between design & implementation - between client approvals and working software, better creative and better technology is produced. Agile Works // Higher Quality Agile Training // Why is Agile Needed? By the 3 rd Sprint of every project, you’ll know the pivot point of where Project Profits balance with Client Satisfaction. With predictable results, projects run on auto-pilot. Knowing this formula, your team is empowered to consistently deliver predictable results. Create predictable results. Agile Works // Predictability • Long-term Business Benefits ✔ Your clients will love the results ✔ Do more with less • Financial Benefits ✔ Increase Profits • Business Culture Benefits ✔ Improve productivity ✔ Produce predictable results Agile Training // Why is Agile Needed? Agile Works // Tangible Benefits • Most of all, use Agile because, it works much better than waterfall for our software projects. But…many organizations fail in its implementation. Agile in it’s current form takes an expert to implement. Agile Training // Why is Agile Needed? Agile Works // Why Use Agile? 2009 State of Agile Survey says the top 2 reasons for Agile failure are: 1. Lack of experience with agile methods 2.

Agile Training // Agile Team Member The Big Picture // Sprint Planning 1. What did you do yesterday? 2. What are you doing today? 3. Is there anything standing in your way? Limiting the daily meeting to 15 minutes increases efficiency and accuracy. In-person meetings reduce email inefficiencies and miscommunication. Frequent, face-to-face check-ins eliminate miscommunication and complexity. Answering just three questions creates clarity and maintains focus. See where you are. See where you are, where you’re going and how to get there. See how to get there. See how to get there. Agile Training // Agile Team Member The Big Picture // Daily Check-In • 15 minute Daily Check-In meeting – Each team member answers three questions: 1. What did you do yesterday? 2.

Are you willing to make the commitment to finish? No matter what? Agile Training // Wrap Up Wrap Up / / Gut Check Forewarnings to new teams • Agile will require a lot of simple things but that aren’t necessarily easy to implement. • It will unveil both things that work well and those that don’t. In existing software development teams, it reveals lots of problems. – It does this by removing the waterfall smoke and mirrors that obscure team-problems. • Here’s an example of what Agile Organizations experience: – As Agile is rolled out in an organization, it naturally removes the opacity usually present in non-Agile projects. Defects in planning, team make-up, management, and even individual performance can be made painfully obvious in very short order. – An organization unprepared for the spotlight that comes with Agile will be spending a large portion of the first couple months digging deeply and disruptively within every Agile team to find the rocks under which the obstacles have scurried. – On the other hand, an organization prepared for Agile's spotlight will be able to immediately use the resulting transparency to identify and remove obstacles while improving productivity and software quality. • Teams naturally do not self-organize. Think of any example in your business or personal life where people actually self-organize. They don’t. They need leadership and structure to provide the environment for self-organization. • The solution to this is to provide enough structure and rigor so that people can be free to be successful. • Agile works best when teams are physically co-located, projects have dedicated resources and the individuals have made a choice/commitment to successfully completing the project.

Welcome to Agile Foundation Training • Introduction (15 min) • Why is Agile Needed? (60 min) − Waterfall is a Toaster − Our World has Changed Significantly − Agile Works − Exercise #1 - Productivity • Break (15 min) • Learn How to be a Agile Team Member (60 min) − The Big Picture − Agile Tools − Team Roles − Exercise #2 – The Art of the Possible • Break (15 min) • Putting it Into Action – Agile Exercise (60 min) • Wrap-Up (15 min) Agenda Introduction // Ground Rules • Be here: Show up on time – Agile is all about teamwork, and it is disrespectful to the team members who did show up on time. To improve responsibility for timeliness, assign penalties such as buying lunch for latecomers. • Stay Present – No cell phones, no laptops, no leaving the room. • Everything is Time Boxed – The Time Box nature of Agile is designed to encourage decisive thinking to facilitate moving forward quickly. • Please ask Questions – This training is for You. (Ask any and all questions that occur.) • Have fun! Agile Training // Introduction What do you want to get out of today? • What do you know about Agile? – What have you heard about Agile? – What are the challenges to adoption? – What are the challenges to implementation? • Describe how project management has been for you in the past. – How do you get directions i.e. how do you receive your marching orders? – Has it been empowering to you? – How much time do you spend being managed vs. doing actual work? Why? – What would work better? – In your past experience, what’s been the value of a Project Manager? • What areas would you like to focus on? Agile Training // Wrap-Up The Pitfalls of Agile • What Agile is not: 1. Doing the daily stand up and then continuing your projects the same old way you used to. 2. Doing the phases of waterfall like scope, design or build in 4-week chunks. − Having Creatives do their work and then handoff documents/designs for Technology to implement. 3. And finally, it’s not doing Fixed Price, Fixed Scope and Fixed Cost SOW’s. • Teams naturally do not self-organize. − Think of any example in your business or personal life where people actually self-organize. They don’t. They need leadership and structure to provide the environment for self-organization. • Agile works best when teams are physically co-located, projects have dedicated resources and the individuals have made a choice/commitment to successfully completing the project.

Agile Training // Why is Agile Needed? • Waterfall is predictive. Its core assumption is that you can accurately and precisely plan and predict how to achieve an outcome of a project. • Agile on the other hand is empirical. Its core assumption is that you cannot accurately and precisely plan and predict the outcome of a project. – Typical Agile says “fix the time and cost but scope is completely unknown” – This is a tough sell Agile Training // Why is Agile Needed? Waterfall // It’s a Toaster • I split the difference. The teams l lead can – and must- define an outcome of a project, you just can’t predict precisely and accurately how much scope will be delivered. • “The Promise” and “The Stretch” – this is how you make Agile work in the real world. Waterfall // It’s a Toaster Agile Training // Why is Agile Needed? • What rules in this environment is the PLAN. • That’s why it takes so long up front. • But, plans are way overrated. Waterfall // The Plan Agile Training // Why is Agile Needed? “Everyone has a plan…until they get punched in the face.” ~ Mike Tyson, boxer Waterfall // Can Anyone Relate To This?

Further results indicate 52.7% of projects will cost 189% of original estimates. On the success side, the average is only 16.2% for software projects that are completed on-time and on-budget. In the larger companies, the news is even worse: only 9% of their projects come in on-time and on-budget. Agile Training // Why is Agile Needed? Our World // The Stats “In the United States, we spend more than $250 billion each year on IT application development of approximately 175,000 projects. The average cost of a development project for a large company is $2,322,000; for a medium company, it is $1,331,000; and for a small company, it is $434,000. A great many of these projects will fail. Software development projects are in chaos, and we can no longer imitate the three monkeys -- hear no failures, see no failures, speak no failures.” “The average is only 16.2% for software projects that are completed on- time and on-budget. In the larger companies, the news is even worse: only 9% of their projects come in on-time and on-budget. And, even when these projects are completed, many are no more than a mere shadow of their original specification requirements. Projects completed by the largest American companies have only approximately 42% of the originally-proposed features and functions. Smaller companies do much better. A total of 78.4% of their software projects will get deployed with at least 74.2% of their original features and functions.” Agile Training // Why is Agile Needed?

Agile Works // Why Use Agile Clients love the results. Agile Training // Why is Agile Needed? “Your system is really relieving a lot of my stress about the management of ASB and our ability to take on big new projects.” ~ R Blank, CTO Almer/Blank “You guys are giving me the confidence to open up more business to you.” ~ Kurt Kratchman, President, ASB “The biggest value has been the lack of hands on management from my end. AND I’m getting what I expect in terms of project quality.” ~ Michael Smith, Head of Engineering, INQ Mobile Agile Works // Client Satisfaction And they sign up for new projects, over and over… Agile Training // Why is Agile Needed? In 5 months, my client created two, long-term, repeat clients with this system. • “ASB” started with 1 Sprint. Now it’s on Sprint 9 and still going. • INQ Mobile also started with 1 Sprint. Now it’s on Sprint 5 with 8 Sprints more planned. Agile Works // Repeat Business Do more with less. Agile Training // Why is Agile Needed? Reduce management effort by up to 40%. My recent teams calculated that each team member saved 6 hours per week of “management time.” On an 8 person team, that’s 192 hours per month that the team now has available to do actual project work. What could you do with this extra capacity? Agile Works // Efficiently Increase profits. Agile Training // Why is Agile Needed? Projects always come in under budget. My last 14 Sprints all came in under budget. • No charge-backs, no schedule slip, no change requests. Guaranteed margins. 8 of the 14 Sprints had an extra 9%- 26% profit. Example: for an $87,000 Sprint, final gross margin was $54,000 or 62% margin. Agile Works // Profitability Improve productivity. Agile Training // Why is Agile Needed? No more “project fires” in your email. No more late night calls. No more meetings. Work is handled…at work. People can take vacations without worry. Michael: focuses on his “other projects” Tom: vacations in France. Markus: works on new business People do high value work instead of putting out fires or sitting in meetings. Agile Works // Productivity Create higher quality work. Agile Training // Why is Agile Needed? Because of collaborative teamwork, design and build are closely integrated to produce better results. But mostly, because of shortened feedback loops between design & implementation - between client approvals and working software, better creative and better technology is produced. Agile Works // Higher Quality Agile Training // Why is Agile Needed? By the 3 rd Sprint of every project, you’ll know the pivot point of where Project Profits balance with Client Satisfaction. With predictable results, projects run on auto-pilot. Knowing this formula, your team is empowered to consistently deliver predictable results. Create predictable results. Agile Works // Predictability • Long-term Business Benefits ✔ Your clients will love the results ✔ Do more with less • Financial Benefits ✔ Increase Profits • Business Culture Benefits ✔ Improve productivity ✔ Produce predictable results Agile Training // Why is Agile Needed? Agile Works // Tangible Benefits • Most of all, use Agile because, it works much better than waterfall for our software projects. But…many organizations fail in its implementation.

Agile Training // Wrap Up Wrap Up / / Gut Check Forewarnings to new teams • Agile will require a lot of simple things but that aren’t necessarily easy to implement. • It will unveil both things that work well and those that don’t. In existing software development teams, it reveals lots of problems. – It does this by removing the waterfall smoke and mirrors that obscure team-problems. • Here’s an example of what Agile Organizations experience: – As Agile is rolled out in an organization, it naturally removes the opacity usually present in non-Agile projects. Defects in planning, team make-up, management, and even individual performance can be made painfully obvious in very short order. – An organization unprepared for the spotlight that comes with Agile will be spending a large portion of the first couple months digging deeply and disruptively within every Agile team to find the rocks under which the obstacles have scurried. – On the other hand, an organization prepared for Agile's spotlight will be able to immediately use the resulting transparency to identify and remove obstacles while improving productivity and software quality. • Teams naturally do not self-organize. Think of any example in your business or personal life where people actually self-organize. They don’t. They need leadership and structure to provide the environment for self-organization. • The solution to this is to provide enough structure and rigor so that people can be free to be successful. • Agile works best when teams are physically co-located, projects have dedicated resources and the individuals have made a choice/commitment to successfully completing the project.

      "articleBody": "! ! ! ! TO MAKE SENSE OF THE SENSE OF THE SITUATION (Especially if Complex) People with this WHY observe, take in elements of every situation they are in and make sense out of them. They take complicated, or what may appear to be complicated, factors, problems and concepts and organize them to create solutions that are sensible and easy to implement. They are highly “solution” oriented and excellent problem solvers. In conversation with people that have this WHY, you might hear them say, “OK, I got it. Given all that, let’s do it this way...”. People with this particular WHY can be very successful management consultants, visionaries, leaders, authors, executives and analysts. They typically can be viewed as experts because they can find solutions quickly. They may also be authors as they can use their skill to summarize complicated issues in writing. TO FIND A BETTER WAY People with this WHY constantly seek better ways to do things. They can’t stop themselves from “trying to do it better”. They take virtually anything and want to improve upon it, make it better and share their improvement with the world. They invent things. As you discuss something with them, they are asking themselves; “what if we did it this way?” or “maybe this would work better...” People with this particular WHY contribute with constant innovations, better processes and systems and operate under the motto, “often pleased, never satisfied”. They are also very good at associating --‐ taking from one industry and applying to another. Often people with this WHY are competitive, athletic, inventors, architects, dentists, business people, process engineers and tinkerers. TO CONTRIBUTE TO A GREATER CAUSE OR TO HELP OTHERS People with this WHY feel compelled to be a part of a greater cause. They don’t want to be the cause, simply to participate and offer their contribution. They love to support and relish the success of the greater good, the company, the team, or whatever the cause may be. You will often find them behind the scenes looking for ways to make the world a better place. You may also find them in more of a public forum trumpeting a movement or message. People with this WHY are go-to people, the ones you look for when you need help with just about anything. They make reliable and committed teammates and are often found in all areas of athletics. People with this WHY may be planners, coaches, caterers, help and support desk personnel, ministers, political campaign workers, restaurant staff, and cause leaders. TO CHALLENGE THE STATUS QUO (To Think Differently) People with this WHY always think outside the box and rebel against the typical or classical way of doing things. They aggressively seek unique solutions that no one else has considered to existing problems and challenges. They are extremely entrepreneurial and love innovation, particularly if it is a “game changer”. They look to “create” a market versus “serve” the market and constantly challenge the existing status quo in any area. They often have a broad variety of diverse interests. In a discussion with a person with this WHY, they may challenge you with comments such as, “Why not?” and “What if we looked at this from a completely different point of view?” People with this WHY include innovators, fashion designers, inventors, entrepreneurs, artists, CEOs, out-of-the-box thinkers, rebels with (or without) a cause and musicians. TO MASTER THINGS People with this WHY seek deep amounts of information over a broad variety of topics. They will pick a specific subject and begin to learn about it, often for the sheer joy of curiosity of knowing something new. They gather and retain substantial knowledge in different areas. Typically viewed as “experts” in numerous disciplines by many, they will insist that they have yet to truly master them. They are fearless about new subjects or ideas. In a discussion with a person with this WHY, you might hear them say “Wait. We need to think about this first.” People with this WHY include experts, artisans, master teachers, artists, academicians, polymaths, master craftsmen, theorists, programmers, statesmen and surgeons. TO CREATE RELATIONSHIPS BASED ON TRUST People with this WHY believe that trust is the most important thing and will work hard to create it. They will become educated as experts in a particular subject and demonstrate that expertise as a way of establishing trust. They will do things “right” in order to demonstrate that they are trustworthy. They want to know that you believe in them and will go the extra mile to demonstrate that with their actions, words and deeds. In communication with someone with this WHY, you might hear words along the lines of, “You can count on me.” People with this WHY include accountants, support staff, service oriented professions such as chiropractic, physical therapy, caregivers and nurses. TO DO THINGS THE RIGHT WAY People with this WHY believe there is a right way to do things and that things should be done right. They do not cut corners nor skimp on the details. They follow procedures, are results driven and believe that if the proper system is followed correctly, you will achieve the “right” results, those desired by the company. They believe in creating structures and processes for clarity and simplicity and the correct running of operations. In speaking with people with this WHY, you might hear them say “Let’s do this right.” People with this WHY include architects, military personnel, firefighters, comptrollers, CEOs, accountants, lawyers, managers, operations experts and engineers. TO SIMPLIFY People with this WHY take what needs to be done and break it down into its simplest form. They remove unnecessary elements and streamline as a matter of course. You might hear them say “Well, the simple way to do that would be...”. They eliminate complexity in everything they do for the benefit of everyone else. People with this particular WHY make great engineers, strategists, writers, artists and teachers. TO CLARIFY People with this WHY are always looking to be fully understood in all communications. They want to know that you “get” what they are saying, and may find multiple ways of expressing a point. They will use analogies and metaphors to help offer multiple points of view on a particular topic that they are sharing. They feel successful when they know that their message is landing completely. People with this particular WHY make fantastic coaches, teachers, speakers and public figures",
